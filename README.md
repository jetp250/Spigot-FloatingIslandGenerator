# Spigot-FloatingIslandGenerator
a Floating island generator for Spigot, a Minecraft server API &amp; software.

Feel free to contribute! The project is more about performance and testing the limits of Spigot world generation performance, not really the look of the outcome. I personally think the islands do look really bland, as of now at least; but hopefully I can change that once I add some decoration such as trees, grass, plants, roads and possibly more.

Currently looks like this. Boring, empty terrain.
